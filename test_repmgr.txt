1:SWITCHOVER:


on standby:

RUN 'repmgr standby switchover' ON STANDBY.


2: Failover

case 1: primary fails

on standby:

run 'repmgr standby promote'


problem:

Now the primary is up and both are running as primary.
we have to switch former primary to standby
so for this 

stop postgresql-11
run ' repmgr node rejoin -d 'host=10.65.200.21 user=repmgr dbname=repmgr' --force-rewind'

if the timelines does'nt match, run the above command again to make the database consistent


case 2: Standby fails


If the database is in old state and the faulty standby becomes live, the primary will automatically
replicate the missing archives in the standby.


case 3:

->table deleted from primary
->changes replicated to DR
->stop primary
->Restore using PITR on primary
->start primary node
-> we will see both are acting as a standby
->execute  psql -c 'select pg_wal_replay_resume()' on primary server to complete its recovery state.
->rejoin standby node again



case 4:

if a database file is deleted from one server, it wont be replicated on DR server so 

->stop postresql on main server
->copy the required file from DR with proper permissions and place it in main server directory 
so the database will read it correctly.
