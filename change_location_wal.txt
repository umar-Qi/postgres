1) Make sure your postgres is not running!

2) mount your WAL disk to an easy accessible folder

3) check the permissions of your WAL directory ($PG_DATA/pg_xlog/)

4) copy or move all files from $PG_DATA/pg_xlog/ into this directory

5) unmount the WAL disk and remount it to $PG_DATA/pg_xlog/

6) Check the permissions and fix if necessary (of the directory and files inside)
Start postgres again
